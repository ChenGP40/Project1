            <h2>What is PCA-PAM50?</h2>
            <p> PCA-PAM50 is used to perform intrinsic subtyping for breast cancer gene expression data. 
                PCA-PAM50 leverages principal component analysis (PCA) and iterative PAM50 calls to derive the gene expression-based ER status. 
                This generates an ER-balanced subset which is automatically used for gene centering and subsequent intrinsic calls. 
                Thus, PCA-PAM50 performs intrinsic subtyping in ER status unbalanced cohorts. </p>
            
            <p> Input is just the normalized PAM50 gene expression matrix. </p>

            <p> The package contains two R scripts:<br>
                <span class="indent">PCA-PAM50.R             → makes use of two functions to make median values and subsequent PAM50 calls.</span><br>
                <span class="indent">functions_PCA-PAM50.R   → provides necessary functions.</span><br> </p>

            <p> The package comes with a sample/TEST PAM50 matrix to demonstrate running the program:<br>
                <span class="indent">'TEST.ihc' and 'TEST.matrix' is provided → substitute these to make calls for your data.</span><br>
                <span class="indent">To make conventional intrinsic calls that are only using IHC, use the function "makeCalls.ihc".</span><br>
                <span class="indent">Refer to 'PCA-PAM50.R' to learn more.</span><br> </p>

                <h3>Prerequisites</h3>

            <p> <b>Hardware</b><br>
                PCA-PAM50 is an R script and should run on any computer (Linux/Unix, Windows or Mac) with R installed. 
                However it has only been tested on Linux/Ubuntu. </p>

            <p> <b>Software</b><br>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p> The 'bioclassifier_R' folder contains all the functions and fixed parameters. 
                You should not need to change anything in this folder, but there are some annotation files, the centroids file, 
                and related information that you may want to be familiar with. </p>

            <p> The directory named 'bioclassifier_example' contains two files - an example input data matrix, and an example of the parameter file to run the algorithm.
                All changes should be made to this R file, and I have labeled the variables accordingly.  
                As a first test, simply fill in the correct directory paths and source the file.
                The output of this run should look like the set of files in the 'sampleOutput' sub-folder. </p>

            <p> As you are probably aware, measurement bias and population bias are often confounded when we attempt cross-platform classification.
                When the test sample draws from the same population as the training set, then the population bias is less of a problem and simple approaches 
                to adjusting for measurement bias (gene centering) tend to work quite well. 
                However, as the test sample deviates from the training sample, 
                the confounded effects become more difficult to overcome and allow for accurate classification.
                An example of an extreme case would be a test sample that was all ER+. </p>

            <p> One valuable resource in checking the pre-processing is if you have any true 'normal' samples.  
                When true normal samples are not called 'normal-like', then it is an indicator of bias. </p>

            <p> You are likely more informed of such issues than myself, but I feel I must give this disclaimer whenever I provide the code.  
                I would be happy to discuss with you further regarding approaches for minimizing bias.  
                Please let me know if you are interested, and please let me know if you have trouble running or interpreting the code. </p>
